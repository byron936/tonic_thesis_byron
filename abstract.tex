Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network has been a promising technology due to the wide spread coverage area and high data throughput. However, with the high speed of satellites, frequent handover is unavoidable for user equipments (UEs) on the ground, causing significant interruption time and signaling overhead. Thus, we introduce a quasi-earth-fixed satellite beam scheme to solve the continually handover from the UEs at the cell edge. In this scheme, we allocate the satellite beams to the ground cells in order to maximize overall throughput. After that, we also propose a UE cell selection algorithm, which base on both position information and UE measurement.
