% NTN introduction
Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) have emerged as a promising solution for next-generation communication systems. They enable network connectivity in areas that are beyond the reach of conventional terrestrial infrastructure. In particular, in natural environments such as forests, oceans, and deserts, terrestrial networks are not only impractical to deploy due to the sparse distribution of user equipment (UE) but also environmentally unsustainable, as their construction may cause significant ecological disturbance. A variety of platforms can be employed to provide network services in NTNs, including geostationary Earth orbit (GEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO), and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude drones. Among these, LEO satellite systems have attracted the most attention in recent research. Operating at altitudes ranging approximately from 500 km to 2000 km, LEO satellites offer global coverage comparable to GEO and MEO systems but with significantly shorter propagation distances. This feature leads to reduced latency and lower propagation loss, thereby improving the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and enhancing overall data throughput performance.

% beamforming and multiple cells
Practically, each LEO satellite covers a vast service area to achieve global coverage. However, transmitting signals using a single beam encompassing the entire coverage area is impractical, as the resultant SNR at the ground UE would be insufficient. To ensure the required received SNR at the UE side, beamforming techniques are employed to concentrate the beam energy and illuminate specific spots, which correspond to cells within the overall coverage area. By employing this approach, the entire coverage area is effectively partitioned into tens or even hundreds of smaller cells. Consequently, a critical challenge arises regarding the optimal allocation of resources among these cells in order to maximize overall network performance and efficiency.

% delay
In the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) 5G network architecture, Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) has been identified as a key service category, enabling latency-critical applications such as smart manufacturing, emergency response, and real-time media streaming. Although LEO satellite communication provides the shortest propagation delay among satellite orbit types compared to MEO and GEO systems, the overall end-to-end connection time between a satellite and a ground UE remains relatively large due to factors such as long transmission distances and complex link establishment procedures. Particularly in the initial cell search phase, the process is further complicated in LEO satellite communications due to the aforementioned cell structure, which impacts connection setup latency and resource management.

% Beam number and SSB power 
There are two primary factors influencing the delay in the initial cell search phase of LEO satellite communications: the number of simultaneously active beams and the transmitted power of the synchronization signal block (SSB). Firstly, supporting multiple active beams allows a satellite to serve multiple cells concurrently. With the beam hopping technique, active beams sequentially serve different cells in different time slots, thereby covering the entire service area. To implement multi-beam service, a large-scale phased antenna array must be deployed on board the satellite. The physical size of such an array directly impacts both the cost and the engineering complexity of satellite construction. Secondly, the transmitted power of the SSB affects the success rate of the connection establishment between the satellite and the user equipment (UE). If the transmitted power is insufficient, the UE may fail to correctly decode the signal, resulting in significantly increased connection latency. Conversely, excessive transmitted power is inefficient, as the SSB is a control signal and increasing its power does not yield proportional benefits like data transmissions do. Furthermore, since the total transmitted power is primarily generated by solar panels onboard the satellite, available energy is limited and must be managed judiciously to ensure efficient operation and reliable service.

% However, to acheive LEO satellite network service, there are some key challanges that need to be resolved. One of the challanges is the unavoidable frequent handover~\cite{38821}. The high speed of LEO satellite forces user equipments (UEs) on the ground to switch the serving satellites frequently, as shown in Figure~\ref{time to ho}. In such scenario, the signalling overhead led by handover signals and the handover interruption time are big issues. 3GPP has discussed some solutions to deal with these issues. By using quasi-earth-fixed cell and satellite switch with re-synchronization~\cite{38300}, the frequent handovers are avoided and the signalling overhead is reduced. For UEs that have already accessed to the network, they can receive the upcoming serving satellite information from the previous one. Also, with the help of the ephemeris data of satellies and the position information of UEs, the matching between satellites and UEs has been largely improved~\cite{38331}. Nontheless, for those UEs who have not access to the network, the random access procedure is the only way for them to get into the network. To establish the connection between satellites and UEs, satellites need to transmit synchronization signal block (SSB) to ground for UEs to capture. Once UEs have successfully receive SSBs, the random access procedure starts and the UEs are able to access to the satellite network. Typically in terrestrial network, ground stations send SSB to the serving area every 20 milliseconds. However, the traditional SSB specifications in LEO satellite communication system do not work because the power budget in LEO satellite is so tight that the power is not enough to send all the serving cells in such a short periodicity. Thus, in this thesis we will find out how to deal with this issue by adjust the SSB periodicity and transmitted power.
